This is a simple mode that lets you set a number of words you would
like to write in the current Emacs buffer and periodically indicates
how well you are doing. It congratulates you when you reach your goal.

The only fancy feature is that the count is keeps track of the
countdown by buffer, so you can have multiple goals running
simultaneously if you would like to challenge yourself.

You can use =wwg/set-goal-current-buffer= to set your own goal, or
=wwg/set-1k-goal-current-buffer= which is preset to 1000 words (a day)
as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Mosley][Walter Mosley]] would suggest.

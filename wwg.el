;;; Commentary:

;; A mode that gives you focus in achieving your writing goals.
;;
;; This mode allows you to set a writing goal and achieve it. The main
;; feature is to let you define a number of words and the mode
;; periodically prizes your efforts by printing encouragement messages
;; in the console. The messages shows only when your cursor is in the
;; buffer in which you set a writing goal. This mode also allows you
;; to set multiple goals in different buffers, although it is not
;; advised because distracting.
;;
;; The aim of this mode is to give a structure in your writing. The
;; idea is to write everyday N (ideally 1k) words. The next day you
;; should edit what you wrote, and write some more.
;;
;; Other utilities provide similar functionality:
;; - count-words: Emacs built-in to count the words in the buffer
;; - org-wc: this counts words in Org-Mode buffers
;; - wc-goal-mode and wc-mode: these keep track of how many words you wrote in the modeline
;;
;; This mode differs from the above because encourages you
;; periodically to not surrender your writing dreams.
